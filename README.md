## Description

A simple note-taking app that allows you to create notes and save them to a json file so that they can be retrieved for later viewing. This iteration makes use of routing methodology using the Express library package, which facilitates the process by defining hooks that javascript can take advantage of to simplify the process of handling client-side requests.
